# truenas-unlock-dataset-once-after-each-boot

Unlocks a dataset in your TrueNAS SCALE server, via ssh, whenever the server
boots.

[![CI](https://github.com/hugojosefson/truenas-unlock-dataset-once-after-each-boot/actions/workflows/deno.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/hugojosefson/truenas-unlock-dataset-once-after-each-boot/actions/workflows/deno.yaml)

You run this script from a computer that you **actively keep physically
secure**, for example your laptop.

## Features

- Unlocks a dataset in your TrueNAS SCALE server, via ssh, whenever the server
  boots.
- Does not store the passphrase on disk.
  - Prompts you for the passphrase at the start of the script.
  - You may pipe the passphrase from a command, instead.
- Unlocks the dataset only once after each server boot.
  - If you manually lock the dataset, you probably did it on purpose, so it
    won't auto-unlock until reboot.
  - If you reboot the server, it will unlock it again.
- Runs any executable `.unlockrc` file in the unlocked dataset's root directory,
  if present. You should make that script
  [idempotent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence), so it's OK to run it
  many times. To be precise, it will run `.unlockrc` if this script starts and
  finds the dataset already unlocked from the get-go.
- Afterwards, waits for the next reboot, and runs again.

## Requirements

### On your secure computer (laptop)

- `/bin/sh`
- `unzip`
- `curl`

### On your TrueNAS SCALE server

- Version 24.04 or later,
- SSH service enabled,
- SSH configured with public key-based passwordless login for an admin account,
- The admin account has access to the `cli` command.

## Installation

### On your secure computer (laptop)

```sh
# create and enter a directory for the script
mkdir -p truenas-unlock-dataset-once-after-each-boot
cd       truenas-unlock-dataset-once-after-each-boot

# download+extract the script, into current directory
curl -fsSL https://github.com/hugojosefson/truenas-unlock-dataset-once-after-each-boot/tarball/main \
  | tar -xzv --strip-components=1
```

## Example usage

Examples below assume:

- Server IP is `10.20.30.40`,
- Account that can run `cli` in the server, is named `admin`.
- Dataset to unlock is named `tank`.

### Manual passphrase entry

To type the passphrase manually at the start of the script:

```sh
./src/cli.ts tank admin@10.20.30.40
```

### Passphrase piped from command

If you have a command that outputs the passphrase, for example `pass`:

```sh
pass my-zfs-encryption | head -n1 | ./src/cli.ts tank admin@10.20.30.40
```
